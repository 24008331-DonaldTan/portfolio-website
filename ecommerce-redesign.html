            <h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
            <p>
              This project focuses on redesigning the online experience for a fictional
              sustainable fashion brand called <strong>EarthWear</strong>. The aim was to
              create a modern e-commerce interface that communicates ethical production,
              environmental care and transparent storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many fashion websites feel cluttered and transactional. For EarthWear, the
              design direction was to make the site feel warm, editorial and human-centred:
              large lifestyle photography, clear typography and strong sustainability
              messaging such as “Fashion That Cares” and “Our Commitment”.
            </p>

              <li>

                supporting links.
              </li>
              <li>

            <h2>Reflection &amp; Learning</h2>
            <p>
              This project helped me practise designing a complete e-commerce journey, from
              storytelling on the homepage to the final checkout. I learnt how consistent
              typography, spacing and colour choices can make a sustainable brand feel both
              trustworthy and aspirational.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also improved my ability to design with components in Figma, ensuring that
              product cards, buttons and navigation remain consistent across multiple pages.
              In the future, I would like to extend the prototype with responsive breakpoints
              and simple usability testing to validate the layout with real users.
