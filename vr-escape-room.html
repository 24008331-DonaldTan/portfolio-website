            <h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was to design an immersive escape room
              experience in virtual reality. Players are placed inside a locked
              lab and must interact with objects, discover hidden clues and
              solve a sequence of puzzles to unlock the final door. The focus
              was on creating intuitive interactions, clear visual feedback and
              a tense but fun atmosphere.
            </p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Sketched the room layout and puzzle flow on paper.</li>
              <li>
                Defined a three-stage puzzle sequence: finding codes, combining
                clues and activating the final mechanism.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a simple user flow: <strong>Explore → Discover clues → Solve puzzles → Escape</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prepared an asset list (table, shelves, microscope, notes,
                locked box, door, etc.) and decided which assets could be
                grabbed or interacted with.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Built the room in <strong>Unity</strong> using basic 3D shapes
                and free assets to keep performance high.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented object interaction using <strong>C#</strong>
                scripts (grab, rotate, place objects in correct spots).
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up trigger zones that detect when the player solves each
                puzzle and unlock the next step.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added sound effects and simple lighting changes to give
                feedback when a puzzle is completed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h2>Reflection & Learning</h2>
            <p>
              Through this project I learned how to design interactions for VR,
              including comfortable locomotion, object grabbing and using
              trigger events. I also gained experience breaking down a puzzle
              into smaller steps and testing the flow so players do not get
              stuck too early. If I had more time, I would add a short tutorial,
              more environmental storytelling and better visual effects when
              the player escapes.
